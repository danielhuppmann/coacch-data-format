## Overview

[<img src="./_static/coacch-logo.jpg" width="200" align="right" alt="pyam" />](https://www.coacch.eu)

This repository contains tutorials and guidance for using the **pyam** package
to work with the data format used in the Horizon 2020 project [COACCH](https://www.coacch.eu).

## Dependencies

The Python package **pyam** was developed to facilitate working with timeseries data
following the data format developed by the IAMC;
however, it can also support other applications like the COACCH project data format.

Features include validation of values, aggregation and downscaling of data,
and import/export (i/o) with various file formats (`xlsx`, `csv`, ...)
and table layouts (wide vs. long data).

[Read the docs](https://pyam-iamc.readthedocs.io) for more information!

### TL;DR - Quick install

You can install **pyam** and all its dependencies via the
[Python  Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas)
and on [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

```sh
# conda
conda install -c conda-forge pyam
```

```sh
# PyPI
pip install pyam-iamc
```
